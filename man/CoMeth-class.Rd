positions.}
\description{
An S4 class to store co-methylation patterns at m-tuples of genomic
positions.
}
\details{
The \code{CoMeth} class is based on the
\code{\link[GenomicRanges]{SummarizedExperiment}} class. The main difference
is that rather than using a \code{\link[GenomicRanges]{GRanges}} object as
the \code{rowData}, a \code{CoMeth} object uses an \code{\link{MTuples}}
object.

The assays of a \link{CoMeth} object are the counts of how many times each
co-methylation pattern is observed for that m-tuple in each sample.
For example, the possible co-methylation patterns of 2-tuples are 'MM', 'MU',
'UM' and 'UU' and thus there are four assays of the same names.
