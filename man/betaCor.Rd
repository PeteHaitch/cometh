\title{Compute correlations of pairs of beta-values.}
\usage{
betaCor(comethI, methylation_loci_set, features = NULL,
  ipd = sort(unique(width(beta_vals))), nil = 0, method = c("pearson",
  "kendall", "spearman"))
}
\arguments{
\item{comethI}{A CoMethI object.}

\item{features}{The names of features used to stratify the correlations. The
default, \code{features = NULL} means that no features are used. Otherwise,
\code{features} must be metadata of the m-tuples in the \code{BetaVals}
object, that is, one-or-more-of \code{colnames(mcols(rowData(BetaVals)))}.}

\item{methylation_loci_set}{A \code{\link{MethylationLociSet}} object
containing the positions of all methylation loci in the sample. This is
usually the set of all methylation loci in the reference genome.}

\item{ipd}{An integer vector of IPDs. Correlations will only be computed
using pairs with an IPD found in \code{ipd}. The default value,
\code{sort(unique(width(beta_vals)))}, uses all observed IPDs.
Setting \code{ipd = 0} will removes the IPD strata (see examples).}

\item{nil}{The number of intervening loci allowed in each pair. The default,
\code{nil = 0}, means that only pairs made of adjacent loci are considered.
To use all pairs, set \code{nil = Inf} but \emph{this will take a very long
time (and probably crash) because there are so many combinations}.}

\item{method}{A character string indicating which correlation coefficient
is to be computed. One of "pearson" (default), "kendall", or "spearman",
can be abbreviated. \emph{Currently, only "pearson" and "spearman" are
supported because "kendall" is very slow (see Note in
\code{\link[stats]{cor}}).}}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame}. While the exact format depends on the
parameters used, the first column is the correlation, the second column is
the sample name and the remaining columns are \code{IPD} and
\code{features}, if relevant. Therefore, each row corresponds to the
correlation for a particular "sample-IPD-features" combination.
}
\description{
Given a \code{\link{CoMethI}} object, \code{betaCor} computes the
correlations of pairs of beta-values. Correlations are computed per-sample
and are stratified by the \code{ipd} and \code{features} of the pairs of
methylation loci.
}
\note{
Correlations are computed using \code{\link[stats]{cor}},
with \code{use = "na.or.complete".}
