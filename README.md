[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PeteHaitch/cometh.png?branch=CoMeth_VIRTUAL_class)](https://travis-ci.org/PeteHaitch/cometh)

An R package with tools for analysing, managing and visualising co-methylation data. Loosely speaking, co-methylation is the correlation structure of DNA methylation.

__This package is in very early development.__ Nevertheless, it can be installed (provided it is passing the Travis CI build)  with:
```R
devtools::install_github("PeteHaitch/cometh")
```

The layout of this package is inspired by VariantAnnotation.
