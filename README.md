An R package with tools for analysing, managing and visualising co-methylation data. Loosely speaking, co-methylation is the correlation structure of DNA methylation.

__This package is in very early development.__ Nevertheless, it can be installed with:
```R
devtools::install_github("PeteHaitch/cometh")
```
