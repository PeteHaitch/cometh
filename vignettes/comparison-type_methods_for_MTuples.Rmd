# Aim

I need to define the set set of comparison-type methods for the `MTuples` class.

# Background notes

## `?compare`

Based on the documentation in `?compare` I need to define the following methods (although now all need to be explicitly defined due to the magic of inheritance):

* Element-wise (aka "parallel") comparison of 2 `MTuples` objects
    + `compare`
    + `==`
    + `<=`
    + `!=`
    + `>=`
    + `<`
    + `>`
* `selfmatch`
    + `selfmatch`
* `duplicated` and `unique`
    + `duplicated`
    + `unique`
* `%in%`
    + `%in%`
* `findMatches` and `countMatches`
    + `findMatches`
    + `countMatches`
* `sort`
    + `sort`
* `table`
    + `table`

Based on my reading of the`?compare` documenation:

* Simply implementing the `compare` method should ensure that the `==`, `<=`, `!=`, `>=`, `<` and `>` operators "work out-of-the-box".
* Alternatively, "if `compare` is not implemented, then it's enough to implement `==` and `<=` methods to have the remaining operators (`!=`, `>=`, `<`, and `>`) work out-of-the-box" __but only if there is not a separately defined method for `GRanges` objects because `MTuples` objects first inherit from `GRanges` before `Vector`.__
* Correctly implementing `match` will give me `selfMatch` "out-of-the-box", which in turn will give me `duplicated`, `unique`, `%in%`, `findMatches` and `countMatches` "out-of-the-box" __but only if there is not a separately defined method for `GRanges` objects because `MTuples` objects first inherit from `GRanges` before `Vector`.__
* Correctly implementing `order` will ensure `sort` works "out-of-the-box".
* Correctly implementing `selfmatch`, `order` and `as.character` ensures that `table` works "out-of-the-box" __but only if there is not a separately defined method for `GRanges` objects because `MTuples` objects first inherit from `GRanges` before `Vector`.__

## `?"Ranges-comparison"`

Further documentation in `?"Ranges-comparison"` says I should also implement `order` and `rank` methods. There is also a (somewhat complicated) set of predefined codes for `Ranges` comparison.

__It's not immediately clear whether the `compare` method for `MTuples` should also return something more complicated than a simple `<0`, `==0` or `>-` value.__ For example, `?"Ranges-comparison"` notes that:

> [while] the `compare` method for `Ranges` objects is guaranteed to return predefined codes only but methods for other objects (e.g. for `GenomicRanges` objects) can return non-predefined codes. 

## Implications for `findOverlaps`-based methods

Currently, I've defined a specialised method for `findOverlaps` when `m > 2` and `type = equal`. There might be a better way to do this using the `compare` or `findMatches` methods, if these are correctly defined. __No, the argument becomes circular since `findMatch` relies on `matches` which relies on `findOverlaps`.__

# Methods definitions

## The logic

The following is adapted from notes for the `compare` method defined for `GenomicRanges` class ([https://hedgehog.fhcrc.org/bioconductor/trunk/madman/Rpacks/GenomicRanges/R/GenomicRanges-comparison.R](https://hedgehog.fhcrc.org/bioconductor/trunk/madman/Rpacks/GenomicRanges/R/GenomicRanges-comparison.R))

### 0. ONLY `MTuples` OBJECTS WITH THE SAME `m` CAN BE MEANINGFULLY COMPARED
For example, there is no meaningful way to compare a 1-tuple to a 5-tuple.

### I. UNIQUE AND DUPLICATED ELEMENTS WITHIN A `MTuples` OBJECT
Two elements of an `MTuples` object (i.e. two m-tuples) are considered equal iff they are on the same underlying `sequence` and `strand` (including identical `seqinfo`), and have the same `pos` (`pos1, pos2, ..., posm`).

### II. ORDERING THE ELEMENTS OF AN `MTuples` OBJECT
The "natural order" for the elements of an `MTuples` object is to order them (a) first by sequence level, (b) then by strand, (c1) then by `pos1`, (ci, `i = 2, ..., m - 1`) then by `posi`, (cm) then by `posm`. This differs to the natural order of `GenomicRanges`, which, using this notation, have steps (c1), ..., (cm) replaced by (c) `pos1` and (d) `posm`.

### III. ELEMENT-WISE (AKA "PARALLEL") COMPARISON OF 2 `MTuples` OBJECTS
We want the `==`, `!=`, `<=`, `>=`, `<` and `>` operators between 2 `MTuples` objects to be compatible with the "natural order" defined previously. Defining those operators when the 2 objects have *identical* `seqlevels()` is straightforward but we can in fact extend this comparison to the following situation:

1. `e1` and `e2` have compatible sets of underlying sequences, that is, `seqinfo(e1)` and `seqinfo(e2)` can be merged.
2.  `seqlevels(e1)` and `seqlevels(e2)` are in the same order. Note that (A) guarantees that the `seqlevels` of one is a subset of the `seqlevels` of the other. (B) is saying that this subset should be a subsequence.

Pre-comparison step: if (A) and (B) are satisfied, then the 2 `seqinfo()` are merged and the `seqlevels()` of the result is assigned back to each object to compare. This is a way to have 2 objects with identical `seqlevels()` before the comparison can actually be performed and meaningful. The reason (B) is required for the pre-comparison step is because we want this step to preserve the original order of the `seqlevels()` in *both* objects. Without this precaution, the expected anti-symetric property of some operators would not be satisfied e.g. `any(e1 < e2 & e2 < e1)` could be `TRUE`.

## `compare`

From `?compare`:

> Doing `compare(x, y)` on 2 vector-like objects `x` and `y` of length 1 must return an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if the single element in `x` is considered to be respectively less than, equal to, or greater than the single element in `y`. If `x` or `y` have a length != 1, then they are typically expected to have the same length so `compare(x, y)` can operate element-wise, that is, in that case it returns an integer vector of the same length as `x` and `y` where the i-th element is the result of compairing `x[i]` and `y[i]`. If `x` and `y` don't have the same length and are not zero-length vectors, then the shortest is first recycled to the length of the longest. If one of them is a zero-length vector then `compare(x, y)` returns a zero-length integer vector.

I do not yet have a set of predefined codes to assign m-tuples on the same space (i.e. on the same underlying sequenc and strand). In fact, I'm not even sure whether this is possible given the multitude of ways that two m-tuples can overlap, particularly with large `m`. Instead, I will keep things simple and just return a value less than zero (`x < y`), equal to zero (`x == y`) or greater than zero (`x > y`).

## Element wise (aka "parallel") comparison of 2 `MTuples` objects

We only need to implement `==` and `<=` methods. The other comparison binary operators (`!=`, `>=`, `<`, `>`) will then work out-of-the-box on `MTuples` objects thanks to the methods for `Vector` objects.

## `duplicated`

~The current R-based `duplicated` method is very slow, taking roughly $44$ seconds when `length(x)` = $2, 000, 000$ and `m` = 3. Running `duplicated` on a `GRanges` object with $2,000,000$ elements takes only $0.3$ seconds, thanks to a C-level implementation.~

Now fixed. Takes less than 1 second to run `duplicated` on an MTuples oject with `m` = 3 and $2,000,000$ rows.

`unique()` will work out-of-the-box on a `MTuples` object thanks to the method for `Vector` objects.

## `match`

`%in%` will work out-of-the-box on `MTuples` objects thanks to the method for `Vector` objects.

# Other notes
For fully generality, that is, to mimic `IRanges`/`GenomicRanges` behaviour, I really should define a `MTuples` class that is solely contains `pos` data and then define a `GenomicMTuples` class that includes `seqnames`, `strand` and `pos` as an `MTuples` object. 

I would then define a "tuples algebra" on the `MTuples` object, analogous to the "Allen's interval algebra" implemented for `IRanges` objects. Then comparison methods for `GenomicMTuples` objects would involve partial inheritance from those defined for `MTuples` objects. The `compare` method for `MTuples` would need special codes, like those used by `IRanges`. However, this is quite complicated due to the sheer number of possible m-tuples and their corresponding "overlaps".

__However, this is overkill for my humble package(s). If m-tuples are considered by other Bioconductor members to be a generally useful concept, then it would be worth investing the time and effort to have the `MTuples`/`GenomicMTuples` infrastructure more closely mimic the `IRanges`/`GenomicRanges` infrastructure.__
