### bestCor: Compute within-sample correlations of beta-values.
###
### betaCor defers to specific methods depending on what parameters it is 
### passed.
### TODO: Add parallel-support either via parallel or BiocParallel. Should 
### parallelisation be by sample or by strata?
### TODO: Add option to specify the minimum number of observations per strata in
### order to compute a correlation for that strata?
### TODO: Extend to between-sample correlations of beta-values. This includes 
### between-sample correlations within each pair of loci and or between pairs of
### loci with the same feature-strand-IPD ombination (fsipdc).

#' Compute correlations of pairs of beta-values.
#' 
#' Given a \code{\link{CoMeth1}} object, \code{betaCor} computes the 
#' correlations of pairs of beta-values. Correlations are computed per-sample 
#' and are stratified by the \code{strand}, \code{features} and \code{ipd} of 
#' the pairs of methylation loci.
#' 
#' @param cometh A CoMeth1 object.
#' @param mls A \code{\link{MethylationLociSet}} object 
#' containing the positions of all methylation loci in the sample. This is 
#' usually the set of all methylation loci in the reference genome.
#' If a \code{\link{MethylationLociSet}} is unavailable, then set to \code{NA}, 
#' in which case \code{betaCor} effectively assumes that \code{cometh} contains 
#' all potential methylation loci (this is not recommended).
#' @param ipd An integer vector of IPDs. Correlations will only be computed 
#' using pairs with an IPD found in \code{ipd}. If \code{ipd} is specified, then
#' the number of intervening loci (NIL) is ignore. Only one of \code{ipd} or
#' \code{nil} should be specified.
#' @param nil The number of intervening loci (NIL) allowed in each pair. The 
#' default, \code{nil = 0}, means that only pairs made of adjacent loci are 
#' considered. See the \code{ipd} parameter for information on how to use all 
#' pairs, regardless of NIL. Only one of \code{ipd} or \code{nil} should be 
#' specified.
#' @param feature A \code{GRanges} object. If supplied, the correlations are 
#' stratified by whether the methylation loci overlap a range in the supplied 
#' \code{feature}. For example, correlations might be stratified by whether the
#' loci are from a CGI. The details of this stratification are controlled by the 
#' \code{same_strand} parameter.
#' @param same_feature logical. If supplying a \code{feature}, should pairs of
#' methylation loci be required to be in the same feature (TRUE) or just in the 
#' same feature class (FALSE). Two loci are in the same feature class if, for 
#' example, they are both in CGIs but each loci is in a \emph{different} CGI. 
#' This only affects pairs of loci that are in the feature, i.e., pairs in the 
#' "gaps" betweens features need not be in the same "gap".
#' @param ignore_strand logical. Should the strand of the methylation loci be 
#' ignored (default: \code{FALSE}).
#' @param method A character string indicating which correlation coefficient 
#' is to be computed. One of "pearson" (default), "kendall", or "spearman", 
#' can be abbreviated. \emph{Currently, only "pearson" and "spearman" are 
#' supported because "kendall" is very slow (see Note in 
#' \code{\link[stats]{cor}}).}
#'
#' @note Correlations are computed using \code{\link[stats]{cor}}, 
#' with \code{use = "na.or.complete".}
#' 
#' @return A \code{data.frame}. While the exact format depends on the 
#' parameters used, the first column is the correlation, the second column is 
#' the sample name and the remaining columns are \code{IPD} and 
#' \code{features}, if relevant. Therefore, each row corresponds to the 
#' correlation for a particular "sample-IPD-features" combination.
