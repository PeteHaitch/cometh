### Finding overlaps
###

## TODO: Replace .local() within setMethod calls with a separate (better named) function and then call that function from setMethod
## TODO: What happens if findOverlaps (type = 'equal') with m-tuples (m > 2) when positions are identical but strands differ, e.g. '+' vs. '+' (should be a match) or '+' vs. '-' (should not be a match).

## AWAITING RESPONSE FROM BIOC-DEVEL (https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/bioc-devel/2014-April/005549.html) THAT IS RELEVANT TO THESE METHOD DEFINITIONS
## REPLY FROM BIOC-DEVEL (https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/bioc-devel/2014-April/005555.html): Can remove this method once I have updated to GenomicRanges >= 1.15.46 (https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/bioc-devel/2014-April/005555.html).
## TODO: Once this change is made, update DESCRIPTION with requiriment of GenomicRanges >= 1.15.46.
## TODO: Refinement for ciruclar chromosomes

## There is a specially defined method for findOverlaps when both the query and the subject are MTuples objects.
## This is to allow for "exact" matching between MTuples.
## If either the subject or the query is not a MTuples object then it defers to the findOverlaps method defined for GRanges objects. 

## Similarly, there is a specially defined method for findOverlaps when either the query or the subject or both are CoMeth objects.
## I cannot simply defer to the findOverlaps method defined for SummarizedExperiment because it does not allow for 'type = equal' nor 'select = last' or 'select = arbitrary' (at least in GenomicRanges_1.14.4).
